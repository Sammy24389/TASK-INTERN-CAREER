# Terrorism Dataset Analysis

This repository contains analysis from the Terrorism Dataset, including a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted in Power BI. The analysis provides insights into global terrorism trends over time, the most affected regions, and the impact of various types of attacks from 1970 to 2020.

## Overview

The terrorism dataset includes information on:
- **Dates** and **locations** of terrorist incidents
- **Attack types**, **target types**, and **perpetrator groups**
- **Impact metrics** such as fatalities and injuries

## Key Insights

Some key findings derived from the Power BI analysis include:
1. **Terrorism Trends**: A timeline of incidents from 1970 to 2020, highlighting periods with spikes in terrorist activities.
2. **Most Affected Regions**: The Middle East and North Africa have been the most impacted regions, with significant insights into other high-risk areas.
3. **Impact by Attack Type**: Analysis of different attack types (e.g., bombings, armed assaults) and their relative impact over time.
4. **Casualties and Injuries**: Trends in fatalities and injuries, providing a measure of the human cost of these incidents.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Power BI File**: Open the Power BI file in Power BI Desktop to explore interactive visuals and dive deeper into specific trends or regions.
2. **Excel Dataset**: The dataset (`Terrorism_1.xlsx`) can be used for further analysis if needed.
3. **Insights and Visuals**: You can find summaries and visuals for major findings within the Power BI file or review included screenshots for a quick overview.

## Prerequisites

- [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/): Required to open and interact with the `.pbix` file in this repository.
- **Microsoft Excel or a compatible program**: If you wish to review or manipulate the dataset in its raw form.

## Future Enhancements

Future analysis could include:
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using trends to forecast potential future incidents.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing media or social response to terrorist events.
- **Detailed Regional Analysis**: Further breakdowns by sub-regions within affected areas.
